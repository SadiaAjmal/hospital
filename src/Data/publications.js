                content: "To prevent second or third waves of COVID-19 spread across several countries of the world, it is important to consider certain environmental factors and significance of fomites in enhanced viral spread at low temperature. In contrast to WHO statement that temperature has no effect on COVID-19 spread, we suggest the importance of fomites at lower temperature and several factors such as congested environment, reduced hand washing and preferred indoor activities during winter which may cause increased chances of viral spread. In Pakistan second wave of COVID-19 is even more dangerous compared to the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection and due to negligence in understanding the role of temperature in COVID-19 spread, the daily numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases are increasing day by day. It is suggested to frequently refresh air and improve indoor air quality via wildfire using fireplace during COVID-19. It is highly recommended that, the government must assure implementation of standard operating procedures to prevent viral spread through fomites at low temperature during winter."

                content: "COVID-19 has affected 218 countries across the world and daily numbers of cases are continuously mounting. As of 24th November 2020, worldwide SARS-CoV-2 has infected 59.2 million people and caused 1.4 million deaths (COVID-19 Report 2020). Up till now, specific pharmacological treatment or vaccines against COVID-19 infection are not available. According to World Health Organization (WHO), temperature does not affect SARS-CoV-2 spread (COVID-19 advice for public 2020). However, this statement needs further investigations and confirmation. The part of earth that lies at north of the equator is the Northern Hemisphere and about 90 percent of worldâ€™s population belongs to this region. The meteorological convention state June, July, and August as summer months while November, December, and January as winter months (National Geographic 2020). When we analyzed the COVID-19 infections across the world in 2020, the data from Johns Hopkins University statistics, we found that during 1st June to 31st August, the daily number of COVID-19 positive patients increased from 122917 to 264107 respectively.However, from 1st October to 7th November (within merely 38 days), the daily number of COVID-19 cases spiked 5.5 times (from 285016 to 1570855 cases) (John Hopkin COVID-19 update, 2020). Last year also, in Hubei province of China, low temperature was reported to had greatly influenced COVID-19 infection Liu et al. [1]. It has been reported that by decreasing 1 unit of temperature increased (2.92 times) the risk of COVID-19 and deaths, while on the other hand increasing 1 unit of temperature decreased in death rate from SARS-CoV-2 virus.
